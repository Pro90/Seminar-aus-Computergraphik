\begin{abstract}


In this paper we compare and analyze different Tangible User Interfaces. TUIs move away from the common input devices like mouse and keyboard and towards a direct interaction with physical objects in order to make the operation with devices more natural. This includes for example the handling of physical objects on tabletops, projections of information onto pieces of pape or using additional devices to get more detailed data. The examples we are going to cover in this paper include applications in architecture, information visualization and learning tools.
