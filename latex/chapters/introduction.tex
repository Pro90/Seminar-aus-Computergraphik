In common user interfaces the ineraction is limited to indirect input methods such as mouse and keyboard. A more natural way of interaction would be to be able to directly touch and manipulate the objects of interest. One of the main goals in using Tangible User Interfaces is to combine visualization of data with direct interaction.
